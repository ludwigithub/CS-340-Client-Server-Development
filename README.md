# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

<H3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? </H3><br>
<p>As the code is developed and tested at the various stages it is important to document each of the steps in the commenting of the code. This makes it easier for others in the future to improve or exapande on current code and processes. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) will allow you to work with data stored in MongoDB. It could be easily transferred and adapted (not to mention time saved) to be used in other MongoDB projects in the future. </p>


<H3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</H3><br>

<p>After gathering the requirements from the client it is important to spend some time developing a "map" for what you would like the project and program to accomplish. This project was a new experience in dealing with large amounts of data and being able to extract useful information for the success of the business. The ability to analyze and manipulate the large data sets through these queries will help in the furture to help show companies how all the data they are collecting can best be leveraged and used to improve all aspects of their business. </p>
  
<H3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</H3><br>
<p>Computer Scientist can work with businesses to extract the most from their data and through analysis that information can be used to drive business decisions and compnay directions that will improve the business and make it successful. Knowledge is power.</p>
